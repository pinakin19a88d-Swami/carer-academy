                                    <li>Gather information about the bank or organization that has invited you for the interview. This will give you a clear idea about the philosophy, work environment and reputation of the company.</li>
                                    <li>Read the job description carefully as to what they expect from you. Evaluate your qualifications, experience, and core competences, areas of strength and accordingly draw up a questionnaire along with your replies to the expected questions.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Interviewers normally ask you to highlight your strengths and weaknesses. Strengths of course can be emphasized more easily but even the weaknesses can be presented in a positive light. For example, ‘I am a little impatient with the people who are not focused enough, or non serious about the work in hand’</li>
                                    <li>Go with a positive frame of mind, without worrying much about the outcome.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Go with a smile (not a grin) on your face, with confidence and determination to succeed in your heart.</li>

                                    <li>Depending upon whether you are being interviewed by one person or a panel of interviewers, greet politely ‘Good Morning’/Afternoon or Evening depending upon time of the day.</li>
                                    <li>If there are more than one person then address them as ‘Sirs/Madams’ and try to encompass them all in your greeting. If there is only one lady in the panel, it is polite to greet her separately.</li>
                                    <li>Most probably you will be offered a seat. Do not sit down unless you are asked to.</li>

                                    <li>As you sit across the interviewer(s), look confident and relaxed. In most cases the interviewers themselves will try to put you at ease. Believe that they are there to let you prove your worth and mean no harm to you.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Try to initiate the discussion which will help you to get edge over the others, however if you are not sure about the topic please do not initiate just for the sake of initiating. If you are not comfortable with the topic then it would be better for you to listen to the views of others for a few minutes and thereafter you can come up with your views on the topic. You should also try to conclude the discussion as it would also help you to create a good impression over the evaluators and at the same time you can always conclude well after listening over the views of other participants.</li>
                            <li>Do not try to speak in a hasty manner just to impress the evaluators, the objective should be to speak well, so have patience and try to intervene in between with well thought over views and present them forcibly.</li>
                            <li>You need to be a good listener during the course of discussion. Take keen interest in what others are saying and try to build over what others are saying. Moreover if you listen carefully you can always take a few clues from others which would help you in building over discussion.</li>
                            <li>Never indulge in any arguments with others, sometime situation may arise that there may be a clash of opinions but you should understand that you are not there to win points over others rather your objective should be to clear the test. So avoid any such situation.</li>
                            <li>Be very polite and have a smile on your face and always show the positive approach by speaking good things about the topic. Don’t talk any negative thing which may create bad impression over the evaluators.</li>
                            <li>Be very attentive and nod your head while listening to others, from time to time, during the course of discussion.</li>
                            <li>Always prepare well for your group discussion, good preparation helps you to boost your confidence which is so vital during the discussion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The points which can give you an edge over others:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you can initiate the discussion in a well manner.</li>
                            <li>If you help the group to keep the things on track and do not let the discussion go out of track.</li>
                            <li>If you coordinate well and try to finish the discussion within stipulated time.</li>
                            <li>If you can maintain your cool even in adverse situations. Even if there are arguments and noise in the discussion you should try to pacify the things and should try to behave in a mature manner as it is a test of your communication skills, leadership skills and your ability to mange the teams well.</li>
